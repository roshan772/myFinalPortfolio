            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>A dedicated Software Engineering student with a passion for full-stack development. I love building dynamic, user-friendly applications that solve real-world problems and make a positive impact.
                I completed my Advanced Level (AL) Examination in the Physical Science stream in Sri Lanka, excelling in subjects like Combined Mathematics and Chemistry. Currently, I’m pursuing my undergraduate studies in Software Engineering, where I’m developing my skills in front-end and back-end technologies. I have experience with Java, JavaFX, and object-oriented programming, and I’m actively learning modern web development tools and frameworks to enhance my expertise as a full-stack developer.
                I’m a guitarist and a cricket enthusiast who enjoys exploring creativity through music and sports. These hobbies teach me teamwork, discipline, and focus—qualities I bring to my development projects.
                My goal is to grow as a well-rounded full-stack developer, mastering the art of creating seamless web experiences while continuing to learn and innovate.
